            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido
            van Rossum, and released in 1991.
          </p>
          <p>it is used for:</p>
          <li>web development (server-side),</li>
          <li>software development,</li>
          <li>mathematics,</li>
          <li>system scripting.</li>
          <p>Python compared to other programming languages.</p>
          <p>
            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to
            the English language with influence from mathematics. It uses new
            lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming
            languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies
            on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope
            of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often
            use curly-brackets for this purpose.

          <p>
            Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command
            Line:
          </p>
          <code> print("Hello, World!") </code>
          <p>
            Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file
            extension, and running it in the Command Line:
          </p>
          <code> C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Python-indentation">
        <header>Python Indentation</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
            Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for
            readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
            Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
          </p>
          <code
            >if 5 > 2:
            <div class="indent">print("Five is greater than two!")</div></code
          >
          <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
          <p>Syntax Error:</p>
          <code>if 5 > 2: print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
          <p>
            The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be
            at least one.
          </p>
          <code
            >if 5 > 2:
            <div class="indent">print("Five is greater than two!")</div>
            if 5 > 2:
            <div class="indent">
              <div class="indent">print("Five is greater than two!")</div>
            </div>
          </code>
          <p>
            You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code,
            otherwise Python will give you an error:
          </p>
          <p>Syntax Error:</p>
          <code
            >if 5 > 2:
            <div class="indent">print("Five is greater than two!")</div>
            <div class="indent">
              <div class="indent">print("Five is greater than two!")</div>
            </div></code

        <header>Python Comments</header>
        <article>
          <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>
          <p>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
          <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
          <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
          <code>#This is a comment print("Hello, World!")</code>
          <p>
            Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore
            the rest of the line:
          </p>
          <code>print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment</code>
          <p>
            A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can
            also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
          </p>
          <code>#print("Hello, World!") print("Cheers, Mate!")</code>
          <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.</p>
          <p>To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:</p>
          <code
            >#This is a comment #written in #more than just one line
            print("Hello, World!")</code
          >
          <p>Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.</p>
          <p>
            Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a
            variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your
            code, and place your comment inside it:
          </p>
          <code
            >""" This is a comment written in more than just one line """
            print("Hello, World!")</code
          >
          <p>
            As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will
            read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline
            comment.

        <article>
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
          <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
          <p>
            A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
          </p>
          <code>x = 5 y = "John" print(x) print(y)</code>
          <p>
            Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and
            can even change type after they have been set.
          </p>
          <code
            >x = 4 # x is of type int x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
            print(x)</code
          >
          <p>
            If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done
            with casting.
          </p>
          <code
            >x = str(3) # x will be '3' y = int(3) # y will be 3 z = float(3) #
            z will be 3.0</code
          >
          <p>
            You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
          </p>
          <code>x = 5 y = "John" print(type(x)) print(type(y))</code>
          <p>
            String variables can be declared either by using single or double
            quotes:
          </p>
          <code>x = "John" # is the same as x = 'John'</code>
          <p>Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
          <code>a = 4 A = "Sally" #A will not overwrite a</code>

        <header>Python Data Types</header>
        <article>
          <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
          <p>
            Variables can store data of different types, and different types can
            do different things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these
            categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Text Type: st</li>
            <li>Numeric Types: int, float, comple</li>
            <li>Sequence Types: list, tuple, rang</li>
            <li>Mapping Type: dic</li>
            <li>Set Types: set, frozense</li>
            <li>Boolean Type: boo</li>
            <li>Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryvie</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can get the data type of any object by using the type()
            function:
          </p>
          <p>Print the data type of the variable x:</p>
          <code>x = 5 print(type(x))</code>
